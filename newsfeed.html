                <p>On 7 October 2023, Hamas launched at least 5000 rockets from Gaza directed against Israel. This killed around 1400 Israelis with many Israeli soldiers and civilians including women and children being taken hostage to the Gaza Strip. Israel launched retaliatory strikes and declared war on Hamas a day later. As of Oct 15, around 2700 Palestinians have been killed and about 1 million have been internally displaced. Israel cut off food, water, electricity, and fuel supplies to Gaza sparking off a severe humanitarian crisis in the region. Israel has asked the residents of Northern Gaza to evacuate the region, while Hamas has asked them to stay put. There has also been an exchange of fire between Israel and Hezbollah after Hezbollah militants fired rockets into Israel from Lebanon and Israel responded with airstrikes in Lebanon.</p>

                <p>Bangladesh has descended into turmoil with the countrywide students-led anti-quota protests claiming an estimated 150 lives so far, besides over 500 arrests and some 2,500 people left injured. On July 21, the Supreme Court of Bangladesh overturned a high court order of reinstatement of a controversial quota system in government jobs, which had sparked the crisis.

                    The new ruling secures 93 per cent of government service positions as based on merit while allocating 5 per cent of the jobs to independence war veterans and their descendants. The balance quota has been earmarked for tribal communities, people with disabilities and sexual minorities.</p>

                <p>Russia launched a series of attacks on the northeastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv and the surrounding region, killing three people, wounding at least six and damaging the office of a Swiss mine-clearing NGO, local officials said.
                    The attack on Kharkiv came as Russia also launched a barrage of drones on southern Ukraine from Russian territory and the occupied Crimean peninsula. The attack wounded three people and damaged port infrastructure as well as commercial and residential buildings in the city of Izmail on the River Danube, local officials said.
                    The Ukrainian air force said it shot down 17 of the 23 drones, most of them over the southern Odesa region.
                    Ukraine’s navy, meanwhile, said Russia had pulled all its vessels out of the Sea of Azov, a body of water connected to the Black Sea.
                    In the Russian capital, Moscow, a car bomb exploded injuring an officer from Russia’s military intelligence agency and another person, according to local media. Turkey later announced that a Russian citizen suspected of involvement in the attack had been arrested in the city of Bodrum, having arrived there from Moscow by plane.
                    Russia’s Defence Ministry also said it scrambled a Su-27 fighter jet to escort two British Typhoon fighter jets and an RC-135 reconnaissance plane over the Black Sea.

<p>Three powerful earthquakes in the space of just over a week have caused devastation for families in western Afghanistan. On the morning of 7 October 2023, a 6.3-magnitude earthquake and several strong aftershocks shook Herat, Badghis and Farah provinces. A second 6.3-magnitude quake struck the region on 11 October. Early on 15 October, a 6.4-magnitude earthquake struck three districts in Herat province.
    There has been significant destruction across already vulnerable districts.</p>

        <h2 class = "text-center">Taliban Ban on Women</h2>
<p>Two years ago, on a spring day like today, the hopes and dreams of Afghan schoolgirls were crushed by the Taliban’s interim government. On March 21, 2022, the Taliban promised to reopen all schools in Afghanistan, seemingly ending the temporary ban it had placed on girls attending secondary school since its return to power seven months earlier.Two days later, while  many girls were enthusiastically preparing to return to school, the authorities reversed the decision and restricted girls over the age of 12 from attending state-run schools. In an apparent attempt to soften the blow, the Ministry of Education said the closure would be temporary and schools would be reopened once it put in place policies that would ensure compliance with “principles of Islamic law and Afghan culture”. Six months later, with no plan in place to reopen secondary schools to girls in the foreseeable future, the government issued a new edict and banned girls and young women in Afghanistan from higher education.</p>

        <p>At least 14 people have been killed after heavy rains triggered flash floods and landslides across Nepal, with disaster teams searching for nine missing, police said on Sunday.

            Flooding in neighbouring India and Bangladesh has also caused widespread damage and affected millions.
            
            “Police are working with other agencies and locals to find the missing people,” said Nepalese police spokesman Dan Bahadur Karki.
            
            People have been killed or are missing in multiple locations, he said.
            
            Monsoon rains from June to September bring widespread death and destruction every year across South Asia, but the numbers of fatal floods and landslides have increased in recent years.
            
            Experts say climate change and increased road construction are exacerbating the problem.</p>
